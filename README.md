## Features Implemented

1. **Middleware Usage**: 
   - Middleware is utilized for handling asynchronous actions in Redux using `redux-thunk` middleware.
   - Middleware is also employed for logging Redux actions and state changes using custom middleware.

2. **Redux State Management with Dux Pattern**:
   - Redux is used for managing application state.
   - The project follows the dux pattern for organizing Redux code into modules, including action types, action creators, and reducers in a single file.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - Helper functions are implemented to encapsulate reusable logic for tasks such as formatting data, making API requests, and handling utility functions.
